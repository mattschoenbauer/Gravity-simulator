This program is a gravity simulator.
It takes in a set of initial conditions (point
masses, positions, velocities), and simulates Newtonian gravitation.
The user has two options: input their own initial conditions, and use pre-made
initial conditions.
All user interaction will happen in the gfx window, which uses a terminal-like
command line interface we designed.
If the user is manually inputting their initial conditions, they will be
prompted to give all the data in the proper form.
If the user is using pre-made data, they can either use data from a file they
provide (with data given in the same order as the manual task) or one of our
own pre-made conditions.
The user will see a list of our pre-made conditions, which are really
fun.
While the simulation is running, to quit the user can press 'q', and to
restart, the user can press ESC.
